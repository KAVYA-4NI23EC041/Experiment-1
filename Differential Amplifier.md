# <ins> Differential Amplifier </ins> <br>
<p>A differential amplifier is a type of electronic amplifier that amplifies the difference between two input signals while rejecting any common-mode signals. It is a fundamental building block in analog circuits, particularly in operational amplifiers (op-amps) and communication systems.</p>
<p>Differential amplifiers process the difference between two input signals, which allows them to effectively eliminate noise or interference present in both signals. They also suppress common-mode signals, removing any DC offset and applying gain only to the desired signal, which is advantageous in integrated circuit (IC) design by eliminating the need for large DC-blocking capacitors. This subtraction feature facilitates the integration of differential amplifiers into negative feedback systems, enhancing amplifier performance.</p>
