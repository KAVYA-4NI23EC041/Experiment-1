# Design and Analysis of Operational Trans-conductance Amplifier Using 180nm Technology  <br>
<b> Abstract </b> - <p>This project presents the design and simulation of a high-performance two-stage Operational Trans-conductance Amplifier (OTA) using 180nm CMOS technology in LT-spice. Unlike conventional operational amplifiers, OTAs generate an output current proportional to the differential input voltage, making them highly suitable for voltage-to-current conversion in analog signal processing. The design focuses on achieving high gain, low power dissipation, and improved frequency stability using Miller compensation. The OTA operates with a ±0.9V power supply, achieves an open-loop gain of 60 dB, a phase margin of 60°, and a slew rate of 10.5 V/μs, while consuming less than 3 mW of power. Key design considerations include optimized transistor sizing, consistent channel lengths, and accurate tail current estimation. Simulation results confirm that the OTA meets critical analog performance metrics and is ideal for applications such as analog filters, sensor interfaces, biomedical instrumentation, and low-power mixed-signal systems. Future extensions include scaling to advanced technology nodes and targeting ultra-low voltage operations for energy-constrained environments. </p>

I.<b>Introduction </b> 
 <p>Operational Trans-conductance Amplifiers (OTAs) are essential components in analog integrated circuits. This 
work focuses on the design and simulation of a two-stage OTA using LT-spice under 180nm CMOS 
technology. The main objective is to achieve high gain, enhanced phase margin, and reduced power 
dissipation through effective compensation techniques.</p>

II. <b>Miller Compensation for Stability in Op-Amp Circuits </b>
<p>Operational amplifiers (op-amps), particularly those implemented using multiple gain stages such as operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs), require compensation to ensure closed-loop stability. One of the most widely adopted techniques for compensation is Miller compensation, which introduces a dominant pole to increase the phase margin of the system.</p>
<p>In a typical two-stage op-amp architecture, the first stage is a differential amplifier and the second stage provides additional gain. A compensation capacitor C_c is connected between the output of the second stage and the output of the first stage. This configuration leverages the Miller effect, wherein the capacitor is seen as a much larger effective capacitance due to the gain between its terminals. As a result, the dominant pole is shifted to a lower frequency, enhancing system stability.</p>
The loop gain of the system can be represented as: <br>
L(s) = A(s)F(s) <br><br>
<p>where A(s) is the open-loop gain and F(s) is the feedback transfer function. For a stable system, the phase of the loop gain ∠L(jω) at the frequency where |L(jω)| = 1 must be sufficiently greater than −180° to avoid sustained oscillations. The difference between the actual phase and −180° at this frequency is defined as the phase margin (PM): </p>
PM = 180° + ∠L(jω_0dB) <br><br>
where ω_0dB is the gain crossover frequency (i.e., the frequency at which the magnitude of the loop gain is unity or 0 dB). <br>
<p>A phase margin of at least 45° is generally considered acceptable, while a margin of 60° is preferred to reduce overshoot and ringing in the transient response. In systems where the uncompensated op-amp has a low phase margin (e.g., <45°), Miller compensation becomes essential.</p>
<p>Thus, Miller compensation ensures that the gain falls to 0 dB before the phase reaches −180°, thereby preventing positive feedback and guaranteeing stable closed-loop operation.</p>
